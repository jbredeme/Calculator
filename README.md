# Simple Android Calculator

This is a simple Android Calculator application. Performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, divison, and subtraction on signed or unsigned integer or floating point numbers. Values are persistent, meaning the user can add n numbers and the resulting sum can be applied in an additional expression. Lastly, this application provides very basic error checking against consecutive double operator expressions and consecutive double decimal inputs.

## Usage
```c
3 + 15.25 / .50 = 33.50
```
